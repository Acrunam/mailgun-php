Mailgun-PHP
===========
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mailgun/mailgun-php.png)](https://travis-ci.org/mailgun/mailgun-php)

This is the Mailgun PHP SDK. This SDK contains methods for easily interacting 
with the Mailgun API. 
Below are examples to get you started. For additional examples, please see our 
official documentation 
at http://documentation.mailgun.com

Current Release: 0.7

Installation
------------
To install the SDK, you will need to be using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) 
in your project. 
If you aren't using Composer yet, it's really simple! Here's how to install 
composer and the Mailgun SDK.

```PHP
# Install Composer
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

# Add Mailgun as a dependency
php composer.phar require mailgun/mailgun-php:~0.7
``` 

For shared hosts with SSH access, you might need to run this instead (contact 
your shared host for assistance): 
```
php -d detect_unicode=Off -r "eval('?>'.file_get_contents('https://getcomposer.org/installer'));"
```

Next, require Composer's autoloader, in your application, to automatically 
load the Mailgun SDK in your project:
```PHP
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
use Mailgun\Mailgun;
```

Usage
-----
Here's how to send a message using the SDK:

```php
# First, instantiate the SDK with your API credentials and define your domain. 
$mg = new Mailgun("key-example");
$domain = "example.com";

# Now, compose and send your message.
$mg->sendMessage($domain, array('from'    => 'bob@example.com', 
                                'to'      => 'sally@example.com', 
                                'subject' => 'The PHP SDK is awesome!', 
                                'text'    => 'It is so simple to send a message.'));
```

Or obtain the last 25 log items: 
```php
# First, instantiate the SDK with your API credentials and define your domain. 
$mg = new Mailgun("key-example");
$domain = "example.com";

# Now, issue a GET against the Logs endpoint.
$mg->get("$domain/log", array('limit' => 25, 
                              'skip'  => 0);
```

Response
--------

The results, provided by the endpoint, are returned as an object, which you 
can traverse like an array. 

Example: 

```php
$mg = new Mailgun("key-example");
$domain = "example.com";

$result = $mg->get("$domain/log", array('limit' => 25, 
                                        'skip'  => 0);

$httpResponseCode = $result->http_response_code;
$httpResponseBody = $result->http_response_body;

# Iterate through the results and echo the message IDs.
$logItems = $result->http_response_body->items;
for($logItems as $logItem){
    echo $logItem->message_id . "\n";
}
```

Example Contents:  
**$httpResponseCode** will contain an integer. You can find how we use HTTP response 
codes in our documentation: 
http://documentation.mailgun.com/api-intro.html?highlight=401#errors

**$httpResponseBody** will contain an object of the API response. In the above 
example, a var_dump($result) would contain the following: 

```
["http_response_body"]=>
  object(stdClass)#31 (2) {
    ["total_count"]=>
    int(62)
    ["items"]=>
    array(1) {
      [0]=>
      array(5) {
        ["hap"]=>
        string(10) "tempfailed"
        ["created_at"]=>
        string(29) "Mon, 19 Aug 2013 19:41:33 GMT"
        ["message"]=>
        string(155) "Will retry in 14400 seconds: me@samples.mailgun.org â†’  
        sergeyo@profista.com 'Hello' No MX for [profista.com] Server response:   
        498 No MX for [profista.com]"
        ["type"]=>
        string(4) "warn"
        ["message_id"]=>
        string(46) "20130819113429.18813.89868@samples.mailgun.org"
      }
    }
  }
```

For usage examples on each API endpoint, head over to our official documentation 
pages. 

This SDK includes a [Message Builder](src/Mailgun/Messages/README.md) and 
[Batch Message](src/Mailgun/Messages/README.md) component.

Message Builder allows you to quickly create the array of parameters, required 
to send a message, by calling a methods for each parameter.
Batch Message is an extension of Message Builder, and allows you to easily send 
a batch message job within a few seconds. The complexity of 
batch messaging is eliminated!
